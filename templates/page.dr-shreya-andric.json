MED. SCI, MBBS (HONS), IFAAD, FACD\n\nDr Shreya Andric is a Fellow of the Australasian College of Dermatologists and has worked in a consultant capacity to the Skin Shark brand. Here, she has acted as a dermatological sounding board and has been the go-to for all acne related questions, as well as advising the marketing team on activities and ingredients to ensure all communication is clear, concise and correct. She has been instrumental in writing The Skin Within program - a free program for all skin within customers aimed at helping them to navigate their skincare journey. \n\nAfter growing up in Hobart where she completed high school and medical school, she moved to Sydney to pursue a career in dermatology. Prior to commencing her dermatology training, Dr Andric worked as a research fellow at Royal North Shore Hospital where she ran multiple clinical trials in psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa, as well as investigator-initiated studies in paediatric and female genital dermatology. She has also published over 25 articles in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nDr Andric completed her dermatology training at Westmead Hospital, The Skin Hospital Westmead, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and Royal North Shore Hospital and has practiced in multiple locations in rural NSW including Dubbo, Port Macquarie, Griffith, and Lismore. These training positions provided her with a wide breadth of knowledge in general dermatology but she has also gained experience in sub-specialty areas including biologics, advanced cutaneous surgery (Mohs surgery, skin flaps, grafts), cosmetic dermatology, paediatric dermatology, genital dermatology (male and female), and cutaneous lymphoma.\n\nDr Andric enjoys teaching and has been involved in teaching medical students, junior doctors, GPs and nursing staff."}}},"order":["our-story-hero","16347045799ea29f6d","16514849138a766a7f"]}
